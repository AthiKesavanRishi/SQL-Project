🧠 SQL Data Exploration & Cleaning Projects

This repository contains hands-on SQL projects where I explored and cleaned real-world datasets using SQL queries. It includes:

📊 COVID-19 Data Exploration

🧹 Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

📌 Project 1: COVID-19 Data Exploration in SQL

📁 Files:

COVID Data Exploration.sql

CovidDeaths.xlsx

CovidVaccinations.csv

🗂️ Description:
This project involves analyzing global COVID-19 data using SQL to extract insights on:

Infection rates vs population

Death percentage by country

Vaccination trends

Countries with the highest infection and death rates

Daily vaccination progress using JOIN, CTE, TEMP tables, and window functions like ROW_NUMBER() and PARTITION BY

💡 Key SQL Concepts Used:
Joins

Aggregations (SUM, MAX, AVG)

GROUP BY, ORDER BY

CAST() and data type conversions

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Subqueries and temp views

📌 Project 2: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning

📁 Files:
Nashville Housing.xlsx

NashvilleHousing RealEstate Data Cleaning.sql

🧹 Description:
Performed data cleaning and transformation on the Nashville real estate dataset to prepare it for analysis. The focus was on:

Handling NULL and missing values

Standardizing date formats

Separating full address into street, city, and state using PARSENAME()

Fixing inconsistent data (e.g., SoldAsVacant column)

Removing duplicates

🛠️ Key SQL Techniques:
UPDATE, CASE WHEN, ISNULL()

ROW_NUMBER() for identifying duplicates

ALTER TABLE, DROP COLUMN

String manipulation: REPLACE, PARSENAME, TRIM

🧰 Tools Used:
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Microsoft Excel (for initial data loading and review)

GitHub (for version control and project showcasing)

📎 Getting Started
To explore or modify these projects:

Open .sql files using your preferred SQL environment (e.g., SSMS, Azure Data Studio).

Load Excel/CSV files into your database.

Execute queries step by step to follow the logic.
